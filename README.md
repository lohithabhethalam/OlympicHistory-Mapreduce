## Introduction
This project is used to implement map reduce functionality on our bigdata source Olympic history.The reason why we chose olympic history as our datasource is because they are many columns which gave us multiple options to map reduce.
## Datasource
Our datasource provides 120 years historic information of Olympic games.Datasource provides 120 years of data.The datasource is structured in excel sheet.

## The challange
What makes it a big data problem? 
- Volume: There is 5MB of data in this dataset and 271,000 records. 120 years of Olympic data is available in this source.
- Variety: This dataset is structured and it is in excel format.
- Velocity: Data will be generated based on when the Olympic games were organized.  
- Veracity: Data is very clear. They are no unnecessary columns and the data was collected from www.sports-reference.com (Links to an external site.) and it seems to be trustworthy.
- Value: Using this data source we can evaluate 120 years of Olympic history data including their gender, their year of participation, season, year and all the other information.
## Big Data Questions
one question per developer. list one question for each responsible party (make sure you can answer the question using MapReduce)
- For each year, I'll calculate the count of male people who participated in Olympic games. (Lohitha Bhethalam)
- For each country, Find the total number of participants. (Poojitha Singam) 
- For each year, Find the average age of players participated in Olympic games. (Divyaharshini Bheemireddy)
